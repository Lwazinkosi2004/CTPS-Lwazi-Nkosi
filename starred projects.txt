Starred project 

Different type of projects

1 https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot
This project stood out for me because creating music bots has been some of the things i wanted to learn so far and i have a big interest in music

2 https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/BlenderTools
Blender is among the other things that I'm eager to learn because there is soo much things to do there like creating 3d models of people, cars or objects

Game coding is another thing i want to learn because I'm always curios on how people create games and that has sparked and  interest in me to learn how to code games
